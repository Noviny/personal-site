# The Current State of Notes

The notes below are absent some of their correct author and source info - going to add this in later and split this between multiple md files

The great tension in designing airships is between weight and security. A plywood frame wrapping the engine is the most efficient design, however a metal shell will do better in a combat scenario, keeping its passengers safe.

The best compromise is normally weirwood panels with an oak skeleton, which keeps it light enough while still being able to withstand some amount of arrow fire. Since Weirwood burns spectacularly easily, the managing of flames and fire is often the second most important part of airship safety, behind falling off. Keeping an airship's paint well-applied is as such a serious priority, not just a point of vanity.

Airships that expect to be fighting against lightning cannons should reassess the trade-offs, as carefully designed metal conduits acting as a carapace can render the weapons largely ineffective, at the cost of the defending airship being slow, and unable to travel large distances.

While lightning generators have existed for more than a century, it is only in the last decade that we have seen the creation of the new lightning cannons. These destructive devices have reshaped aerial  combat in ways that are still playing out today.

A lightning cannon has two main forms of control, the strength of the lightning (power), and the distance out to which you control the lightning before it grounds itself (focus). Adjusting focus to be longer limits the power of the eventual bolt.

Unlike Ballistae, the bolt from a lightning cannon will arc towards a ship, making it nearly impossible to dodge. In addition, the lightning strike has the potential to cause fires, and if it arcs through the battery storage for a ship, can cause them to detonate.

Of course, the bolt must ground itself, and bolts that are angled too close may wrap around back on to the firing ship.

While it may be tempting to assume that the people of Khaladesh are simply enamoured with jewellery, and it is occasionally painted as a sign of decadence, in fact the jewellery of Khaladesh is always of great importance to the people wearing it.

Jewellery is by tradition never purchased for oneself, and each piece that a person holds will be a gift from a friend, relative, or colleague. It is an incredible faux pas to wear another person's jewellery, and it is either buried with a person, melted down, or otherwise destroyed upon their death.

A savvy viewer can tell much from how a person is adorned, from their status, their profession, their political affiliations or even their gender, which is often marked to save on confusion.

The three pieces of jewellery that almost everyone in Khaladesh wears are a necklace given to them at birth, an armband or bracelet given to them upon reaching adulthood, and a ring given to every Khaladeshi by the government to say they are part of the empire.

People with little to no jewellery are normally thugs or vagabonds, and are not to be trusted.

The first full deployment of a lightning cannon equipped ship was in the thirteenth battle of Garseddai. In this encounter, one Khaladeshi dreadnought encountered a small fleet of 130 assembled small vehicles. 

Under the conventional wisdom of the time, this fight should be costly, but easily winnable for the fleet, and they ordered their ships to move in close to harry the larger vessel. It was at this point that the lightning cannons were revealed, with three massive bolts of electricty, arcing from ship to ship. With just three bolts, 70 of the smaller ship had been taken from the air, leaving the dreadnought with a clear advantage, and forcing the smaller ships to try and harry from a distance.

This encounter reshaped skirmishes between airships, and a new, modern war would look fundamentally different from anything that came before.

Ã†ther is the lifeblood of the soul
Stand in the currents of its river and listen silently
Feel the sound of it beating immaterially
Breath in its impermanence slowly
See with your heart the infinite possibility
Tune your pulse to its slow deep rhythm
Let it bloom in you like a storm
* Paradies City Prayer/Meditation

Why would I benefit from trade with Paradise City? Nostrum makes its humble fortune from its wool industry, and this will not help us. Many of the other towns who have been jumping on this Khaladeshi bandwagon should think closely on this too, do their research before simply accepting the words of the Prime Minister.

Of course, everywhere has their habits, their religious or moral qualms. You would do well to understand before you go to trade, but I will refer to one in particular: none in Paradise City will wear anything taken from an animal.

Perhaps you did not know, as you would surely have known if they were all vegetarian, but that is not the case. They will eat the eggs and milk and flesh of animals, but still they hold a prohibition on wearing them strict enough that those looking to profit from trade in wools or feathers or bone or furs or leather should abandon such hopes immediately.

As to allowing Khaladesh easier access to us? Well, the years are war have finished, but we have not forgotten them.

-- Letter from Ekalu Reandre, mayor of Nostrum - this has been circulating among the rich and privileged and so as a matter of fairness we have published it here to allow the people to form their own opinions
