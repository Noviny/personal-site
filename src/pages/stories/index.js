      If you've stumbled across this assuming I'm going to be an amazing writer,
      I'm sorry to disappoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing stories, creating them, is something I have done my entire life.
      It's not somethig I want to be a career, but I can't be myself without my
      stories. Below I've listed some of the ones I'm most proud of writing.
    </p>
    <h2>Novels</h2>
    <p>
      I don't have links to these, but if you're really curious about reading
      them, feel free to reach out and I'll probably send you a copy.

    <h3>Fine Wonders</h3>
    <p>
      Urban Fantasy set in Newtown - A wildly meandering story that I can't
      quite describe the plot or themes of. This is where I cut my teeth
      learning a lot about writing and I'm infinitely grateful to the lessons it
      taught me, and I still have a deep affection for the characters.
    </p>
    <p>Blurb:</p>
    <p>
      Ward has spent his entire life searching for the magic in the world, to
      see the fantastic that he is certain is all around him. With his new
      friend, Kane, they find out that the Other, the realm of the mystical, is
      not a safe space of wonder, but instead has some horrors lurking for both
      of them.
    </p>
    <h3>The Intelligence Designer</h3>
    <p>
      Okay it's been a few years since I checked in on it, but I really like
      this one. It's shorter, more tightly constructed, has actual themes, and I
      got to express a lot of Values through writing it.
    </p>
    <p>Blurb:</p>
    <p>
      Kendra has, apparently, asked for her memory to be suppressed, obscuring
      her past. To help steer clear of those memories her company has assigned
      her a job on a space station, far from anyone who could have known her,
      and a job she doesn't remember learning to do - helping grow the station's
      smaller artificial intelligences.

      This one's a setting I built for my high school friends, which we have
      been inhabiting and exploring for the last three years. Most of this was
      written right at the start, and not kept terribly up-to-date, but it
      helped me create the world we venture into once a week.
