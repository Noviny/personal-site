    <h1>Some v short fiction for an RPG campaign</h1>
    <h2>A briefish explanation</h2>
    <p>
      Kaladesh to Paradise City is a tabletop roleplaying game that I'm running
      with friends from work. It's the first time I've palyed a TTRPG outside of
      my high school friends who have been playing together for *deep breath* 16
      years.

      A challenge I didn't realise I needed to meet was to spend more time
      worldbuilding. There's an aesthetic and feel and space that I want for the
      campaign, and without writing small fiction in the world, I wasn't going
      to feel it well enough to support my normally off-the-cuff DMing style. I
      thought I would share them here because fun. At time of writing this I'm
      writing one a day, but this might be updated less. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

      <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/fae/">Fate Accelerated's</a> pitch -
      I think it's both a more accessible RPG, but also one that's better at
      creating the stories I want in my games. As always YMMV.
