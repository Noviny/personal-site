title: "Oh heck, it's NaNoWriMo already?!"
---

While writing this I thought up a small playlist that fits the themes of this story, and makes me smile:

* _I will not go quietly_ - The Whitlams
* _From little things big things grow_ - The Waifs (original by Paul Kelly)
* _You are such a loser_ - Garfunkel and Oates

For those who want to skim the values/morals/aesops of this post, here they are at the front:

> Completing a large task means learning to complete small tasks regularly

> It's okay to fail, but you should learn from it

> If you'll miss it for a good excuse, you'll miss it for a bad excuse

> Ideas don't matter if you can't execute on them

Oh frigging heck, it's **NaNoWriMo** already? Ugh. I can't do it this year.

Also, apologies, I appear to be having trouble swearing. I beg your indulgence. For all of this really.

Okay, okay, you're probably confused by now, so let's back up.

National Novel Writers Month (**NaNoWriMo**)  is an event(?), organisation(?), life goal(?). To participate, you have to attempt to write 50,000 words over the month of November, or an average of 1,667 words a day. That number is burned into my psyche.

**NaNoWriMo** states itself very clearly. The goal is not to write a quality novel, but to help you develop the habit of writing (quite a lot) every single day. Because to be a successful writer, you need to be writing.

> A writer writes  

Okay, we're flashing back.

Picture this, a younger Noviny. They have just finished university. They have attempted **NaNoWriMo** several times and written 10,000, 20,000 words, but always sputtered out, normally by day 10. There's a lesson in there.

And while they have finished their university degree having done alright, the yawning chasm of the future opens up, ready to swallow them. Their previous ambition - to be a philosopher fulltime - has become untenable. They didn't do _that_ well. My next dream job was storyteller, and because I am often quite a solitary creature, to met that meant noveling.

So let's talk about sustained work.

There's a bravado, nay braggadocio, among a lot of students around how late they started writing their essays, and how late they finished those same essays.  "Oh I started it at 1am when it was due by 5pm and got it in" - "Oh that essay, I wrote it all in three hours". It goes along with declaring how little of the reading you did. How little you could get away with.

The sentences often contain words that indicate shame, but the context and tone of those stories often sound more like pride.

This mentality is, undeniably, dreadful. It valorises the last-minute and the rushed. It tells you to be good under pressure, and damn other ways to work.

My last year at university I had written a thesis. I'm not going to tell you how condensed my time working on it was because I am, genuinely and truly ashamed. More than marks, that failure to take a year-long project and pace it through a year dashed my hopes of being a philosopher.

And my next choice, storyteller, well you are never going to finish a novel over a couple of nights. I saw it before me, if I couldn't do one for this reason, I couldn't do the other.

So there we find me, just a bundle of loathing and anxiety, having tried and failed to do what I wanted and having failed in such a way that it suggested success might not be possible.

And now we come to the scene. It is 10pm and our protagonist is contemplating sleep, but instead he clicks on a video by content creator Sean "Day[9]"  Plott. It's not an auspicious start, but in listening there was a piece of advice. I'm paraphrasing but "If you want to be good at something, you just have to do it a lot - just start, do a little bit today, and it will be awful, but if you do it for long enough you'll get better".

Uh. Okay, I'm sorry for those of you screaming at your screen about how obvious that was. But the important part for young me was 'you don't have to be good, you just have to be doing it'.

So I paused the video, opened up a text editor and wrote the first sentence that came into my head. And then another after some thought about what the everloving heck followed the sentence, and by fits and starts 500 words was written. I unpaused the video and went to sleep, deciding to do this every day. 500 words, but not more. I posted those words and the declaration on line to make it visible if I failed.

And I did. The second day I read the first day's words and went 'okay, what are these characters? What is the immediate next thing?' By accretion, a story and a plan grew, but unlike any other writing project I had ever started I didn't begin with a cool plan for a three book fantasy epic. I began with the first sentence that came to mind, and then just worked on following that up. This led to the important point:

> Ideas don't matter if you can't execute on them  

Being proud of dreaming up a story isn't important. The important thing was if I wanted to be a writer, I had to write. I had to plan my time to write at lunch, or before work if I was going out in the evenings. And if I got home tired at 11pm and still needed to write, it was imperative that I did so.

> If you'll miss it for a good excuse, you'll miss it for a bad excuse - from "Thud" by Terry Pratchett  

And of course, it was dross. Bad prose, odd characters, stilted pacing. But, of course, by the 20,000th word it was better, and it was easier, and there was a plot, and I was having fun.

**NaNoWriMo** that year was like a victory lap. I was travelling, and I devoted days just to writing, slamming out the words in an absurdly short period of time.

Within a year, I had written a novel (though not edited it) and having done so, having succeeded, I got to look back and know that I _was_ capable of this work, I _was_ able to pick a long term goal and work and work and work at it and succeed.

I have completed **NaNoWriMo** once more since then, while working on a second novel that learned so much from all the horrible mistakes of the first novel.  I still haven't published any fiction, but it turns out that wasn't the thing that was going to motivate me.

This year though, I'm not in that place. I'm not writing much anymore, and maybe I should be trying a little more. Getting into blogging was part of that goal, stretch my writing muscles beyond what I do for workmoney. It's good, but it's not the same feel.

## Has this made you better at your job today?

Ah, back in the present. I can't stress enough how much the lessons and failures of writing have led me to myself, to be more sure in who I am, and to back myself in what I can do.

There's a topic here that I don't think deserves its own post but I want to cover. I think my life as I have lived it has allowed me to succeed as a developer, even and especially the bits that seem irrelevant.

Learning to program was hard. It requires accepting that I knew nothing about what I was doing, and I had become so used to being at least passable at anything I chose to engage in. Without the experience of failing to write, then putting in the time and effort and knowing I could learn and grow, I don't think I could have learned, had enough comfort with not knowing to take the time to learn.

There are other stories here too, since this accounting doesn't leave me where I am now, and other lessons.

More tritely, a lot of my role involves writing a lot of documentation, trying to convey thoughts and ideas and instructions clearly , and to make ideas coherent, to empathise with a reader who is trying to interpret what I'm saying. I draw on these skills every day.

But most importantly, it's a rejection of a wish-I-was view that wonders if I had started programming earlier, would I be better off, more advanced, better at it, more knowledgeable. I reject the idea because then I wouldn't be me, and I've been working on being a better me for a while, and that needs all of the experiences I have gone through, and the lessons I have learned from it.

And I hesitate to mention this, because maybe it's not worth much, but the last week, I have been writing again, every day. It's not been a **NaNoWriMo** day's worth, often barely 100 words. It's not adding up to a novel, but it's writing stories, or the hints and edges of stories.

I run a tabletop roleplaying game at work, and I am slowly building a world up for people, for myself. It is getting me back to why I wanted to write, be a writer, in the first place. It wasn't any concept of money_fame_glory, no. What I wanted was to tell stories, because I love stories. And I love sharing stories.

Not every story needs to change the world. I reject stories so dense they take study to derive joy from. No, I want to make stories for me. And if I make a story and it brings joy to someone else, well that's just a bonus, a wonderful moment shared.

One final note on why this is quite so long:
